MY SHORT BIOGRAPHY <hr>
Hey there ! , Those who are reading my Biography thank you so much.
So , Let me start with my birth. I was born in a village called Bharaul of Sunsari district in Nepal.
I am first child of my parents. When I was around two years old , My brother took birth in this world.
I lived in nuclear family from the time of birth with my father, mother and brother.
We used to live in a typical nepali wooden village house.
We had land for growing crops so our family was involved in farming. We also used to run a shop in village attached to our house.<br><br>
When I was around 4 years old I was sent to nearby city called Itahari for my initial phase of study.
My grand parents lived there so I lived there for one year but I returned back to village.
I was among top 10 students in class . For studying about five years in village ,
My parents decided to migrate from village to nearby city, Itahari. Our house was bought by a couple from hilly areas.
So when I was 9 years old , we moved to Itahari.<br><br>

We lived in our grand parents house. My parents thought of building a brick strong house. After 5 months , Our house was ready for living.
We started living there. Me and my brother were admitted in new school which was 10 minutes away from my new home.
 For running day to day life , there requires income,
So my father was in deep thought about earning money. So as days passed by , He started to invest on lands in Itahari.
A group was formed between my father and his friends. They had to invest on land according to percentage.They bought land from owner
and sold it to other costumers and by the end get profit and allocate money to each other according to percentage of investment.<br><br>

My mother is/was housewife. After my 10th standard , there was 3 months of vacation.
For three months I got enrolled for course called "Diploma in hardware and networking" in one of the institutions in Itahari.
I learned a lot about desktop hardware funtionality and networking related stuffs. I passed 10th standard with first division and
I joined nearby High school called " Vishwa Adarsh College (VAC) ". I studied science in my high school .<br><br>
 After two years , I passed my high school with
first division result. After High school , I had a big decision to make. I thought of studying Civil engineering so I
packed my bag and flew to country capital Kathmandu for entrance preparation. I lived in hostel for three months for preparation.
After three months , Entrance result was published . I had passed entrance examination. By the time , my mind was fully changed about what subject to choose.
After attending many seminars and talk programs, I thought of studying Network Engineering at NAMI college in kathmandu.
And I found the college excellent as it has very good course design. The university is great and provides British degree in Nepal.
<br><br>So this is end of my biography , it's my story.
